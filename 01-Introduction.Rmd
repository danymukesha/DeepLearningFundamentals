# Introduction to Deep Learning

## What is Deep Learning?

Deep Learning (DL) is a subfield of machine learning based on artificial
neural networks. The "deep" refers to the number of layers through 
which the data is transformed. While a standard neural network might
have 2-3 layers, a deep network can have dozens or hundreds.

### Key Concepts

-   **Neuron:** The basic computational unit. It takes inputs, 
    multiplies them by weights, adds a bias, and passes the result 
    through an activation function.
-   **Layer:** A collection of neurons.
-   **Input Layer:** The layer that receives the raw data.
-   **Hidden Layer(s):** The layers between input and output where 
    the "learning" happens.
-   **Output Layer:** The final layer that produces the prediction.
-   **Activation Function:** A function that determines the output 
    of a neuron (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid, Softmax).

## Why Deep Learning in Bioinformatics?

Bioinformatics data is often high-dimensional and complex, making it a perfect candidate for DL.

Some examples:

-   **Genomics:** Predicting the functional effect of non-coding variants, chromatin accessibility, and transcription factor binding.
-   **Proteomics:** Predicting protein structure (e.g., AlphaFold), function, and interactions.
-   **Medical Imaging:** Classifying tumors from histopathology images or MRI scans.
-   **Drug Discovery:** Predicting molecular properties and drug-target interactions.

## A Simple Biological Example: Transcription Factor Binding Prediction

Imagine we have DNA sequences of length 100bp. Our goal is to predict whether a specific transcription factor (TF) binds to a given sequence.

-   **Input:** `"ATCGATCGAT..."` (100 characters)
-   **Output:** `1` (binds) or `0` (does not bind)

We need to: 

1. Convert the sequence into a numerical format (more on this in Chapter 3). 
2. Design a neural network that can learn the binding motif and its context.

In the following chapters, we will learn how to build such a model step-by-step.
